        <h2 class="headings1">My Hobbies</h2>
        <p id='hobbiesIntro'>Since my childhood, I was always curious about variety of things. Even before I started my formal education,
        thanks to my kindergarten teacher, I had a chance to try discover my passions about many subject, especially music and sports.
        Even though I was never be a professional sports player, nor a musician, I was into both of them throughout my life. I played basketball,
        fotball, tried karete. Now, I am regularly exercising fitness, and running. Additionally, I am interested in music and I do some
        amateur works. I, also, like travelling.</p>
