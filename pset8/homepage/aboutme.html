        <p>
            I was born in Duzce/Turkey, in 1995 October 2. I had my primary school and secondary education in th city I was born. After I graduated from Arsal Anatolian High School, I started
            studying my undergraduate in Medipol University, which is located in Istanbul. Even though I did not like so much the field that studied for, I decided to finish anyway. In the 4th
            and the last year of my undergrad education, I studied in Warsaw, Poland with an exchange program. It was the year which opened my eyes, and helped me to see the world with a different
            view. After graduating from the university. I went to Toronto, Canada for an English course. Spending 4 months in Toronto was an unforgettable experiece for me.

            After I came back to Turkey, I worked in a private hospital for around a year as a physiotherapist. It was the time that I decided to change my career, since I realized that physical therapy
            is not a good fit for me. Then I started serving for the army. After serving for a year there, I was searching and trying to learn about computer programming. I started doing small things,
            however it was a big step for me. Ever since I finish my duty in the army, I started working for a company, online, which is not related to computer programming. Then I decided enrol for a
            college program to study about it. Additionally, I started taking CS50 course during the pandemic, which is my first big step for learning computer programming.
